# Web-Scraping Project:Analysis ofprice of E-commerce product(TV)
I have analyzed prices of the TV's from flipkart and gave insights on that.
🔍 Journey 1: Web Scraping
Kicked things off by extracting key TV product details—brand, specs, price, ratings, reviews and more—from Flipkart’s site. Cleaned the dataset, standardized formats, handled missing info and scraped reviews for sentiment analysis.


📊 Journey 2: EDA in Python
Ran a deep dive into the data.
 • 👁️ Analyzed pricing trends across brands and categories
 • 🌟 Explored correlation between ratings, reviews, and price
 • 🧮 Determined top-selling specs and their average ratings
 • 📈 Mapped price vs. rating scatterplots, brand-wise breakdowns...
Found patterns, outliers, and great insights — and had a blast visualizing them in Matplotlib and Seaborn.
